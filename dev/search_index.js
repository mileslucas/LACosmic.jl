This algorithm implements the algorithm presented in lacosmicx. The return values are the cleaned image and the bad pixel mask. The image cleaning is done via median interpolation.\n\nParameters\n\nnoise is the pre-determined estimate of the data noise (square root of variance), if any\ngain is the image gain in electrons per data number\nbackground is pre-determined image background, if any\nreadnoise is the read noise of the image in electrons\nmask is an input bad pixel mask, where true represents a bad pixel\nsigma_clip is the Laplacian signal-to-noise ratio for flagging bad pixels\ncontrast is the minimum contrast required to flag a bad pixel in the ratio of the Laplacian image to the fine-structure image\nneighbor_thresh is the fractional detection limit for cosmic rays surrounding other cosmic rays. Should be a number between 0 and 1.\nmaxiter is the maximum number of iterations used for detecting bad pixels\nsaturation_level is the saturation value in electrons\nblock_size is the subsampling factor for the Laplacian filter image.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> image = 100 .* randn(1001, 1001) .+ 1000;\n\njulia> clean_image, mask = lacosmic(image, gain=4);\n\nReferences\n\nvan Dokkum, P.G.

This effectively treats each pixel as block_size x block_size pixels. The value of each pixel is not normalized or averaged.
